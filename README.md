# JavaScript Testing


## My attempt at the [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com) [testing practice](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice)

1. Learnt and implemented TDD for the first time (red -> green)
2. Learnt about jest and how to utilize it
3. Finally used babel with jest for the import feature


Was an interesting look into TDD as a way of programming and tbf its quite neat.
